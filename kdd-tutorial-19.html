<h2 name="abstract">Abstract</h2>
 <p>Spatio-temporal societal event forecasting, which has traditionally
been prohibitively challenging, is now becoming possible and experiencing rapid growth thanks to the big data from Open Source
Indicators (OSI) such as social media, news sources, blogs, economic
indicators, and other meta-data sources. Spatio-temporal societal
event forecasting and their precursor discovery benefit the society
by providing insight into events such as political crises, humanitarian crises, mass violence, riots, mass migrations, disease outbreaks,
economic instability, resource shortages, natural disasters, and others. In contrast to traditional event detection that identifies ongoing
events, event forecasting focuses on predicting future events yet to
happen. Also different from traditional spatio-temporal predictions
on numerical indices, spatio-temporal event forecasting needs to
leverage the heterogeneous information from OSI to discover the
predictive indicators and mappings to future societal events. While
studying large scale societal events, policy makers and practitioners aim to identify precursors to such events to help understand
causative attributes and ensure accountability. The resulting problems typically require the predictive modeling techniques that can
jointly handle semantic, temporal, and spatial information, and
require a design of efficient and interpretable algorithms that scale
to high-dimensional large real-world datasets.
In this tutorial, we will present a comprehensive review of the
state-of-the-art methods for spatio-temporal societal event forecasting. First, we will categorize the inputs OSI and the predicted
societal events commonly researched in the literature. Then we will
review methods for temporal and spatio-temporal societal event
forecasting. Next, we will also discuss the foundations of precursor
identification with an introduction to various machine learning approaches that aim to discover precursors while forecasting events.
Through the tutorial, we expect to illustrate the basic theoretical
and algorithmic ideas and discuss specific applications in all the
above settings.</p>
