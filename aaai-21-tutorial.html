<h2 name="abstract">Abstract</h2>
 <ul><p>The goal of this tutorial is to bring together data scientists, AI researchers, and social scientists to discuss research problems and challenges in computational event modeling. Traditional machine learning models for societal event forecasting focus on predictive performance using structured data. We present new directions of interpretable AI/ML models for predictive analysis in dynamic, heterogeneous, and multi-source event data. The tutorial will cover technical material related to event detection, forecasting, and precursor identification with assumed preliminary knowledge in supervised learning, deep learning, and temporal event modeling.  First, we will introduce formal definitions of event prediction and event precursors, along with a brief discussion on the methods applied in this field. Next, we will present recently developed deep learning methods including dynamic graph convolutional networks in event forecasting and actor (participant) inference. Last, we will discuss real-world applications based on temporal event modeling.
